# Copilot Instructions Builder CLI

A powerful CLI application for building GitHub Copilot instruction files from modular, hierarchical components. Create sophisticated instruction sets using a three-tier architecture: **Base Instructions** â†’ **Domain-Specific Layers** â†’ **Task-Specific Modules**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Hierarchical Module System**: Compose instructions from base, domain, and task-specific modules
- **Smart Dependency Resolution**: Automatic dependency management with cycle detection
- **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**: Handle module conflicts with multiple resolution strategies
- **Advanced Merging**: Smart content merging with semantic understanding
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic content generation with variable substitution
- **Conditional Instructions**: Include/exclude sections based on context and conditions
- **Priority-Based Ordering**: Sophisticated priority calculation for optimal instruction ordering
- **Interactive CLI**: Both command-driven and configuration-driven workflows
- **Performance Optimized**: Caching, lazy loading, and parallel processing
