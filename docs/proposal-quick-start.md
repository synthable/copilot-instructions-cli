## 3-Minute Version

### Step 1: Is a Proposal Needed?

**YES** - Write a proposal if:
- üîß New feature affecting UMS spec
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture changes
- üìê New spec versions

**NO** - Skip proposal for:
- üêõ Bug fixes
- üìù Documentation updates
- ‚úÖ Test improvements
- üîç Minor refactoring

### Step 2: Copy Template

```bash
cp docs/spec/proposals/TEMPLATE.md docs/spec/proposals/[category]-[name].md
```

**Categories**: `feature-`, `breaking-`, `arch-`, `spec-`, `deprecation-`

### Step 3: Focus on These Sections

Most important sections (in order):

1. **Abstract** - One paragraph summary
2. **Motivation** - What problem are you solving?
3. **Proposed Design** - Your solution with examples
4. **Alternatives Considered** - What else did you think about?
5. **Drawbacks and Risks** - What could go wrong?

You can fill in the rest later.

### Step 4: Submit PR

1. Create feature branch: `proposal/[name]`
2. Commit your proposal
3. Open PR with title: `[PROPOSAL] Your Title`
4. Add labels: `proposal`, `needs-review`
5. Tag relevant people

### Step 5: Iterate

- Review period: **7 days** (14 for breaking changes)
- Respond to feedback
- Update proposal
- Get 2 maintainer approvals

## What Makes a Good Proposal?

### ‚úÖ DO

- **Start with Why**: Explain the problem clearly
- **Show Examples**: Use code to demonstrate
- **Be Specific**: Concrete over abstract
- **Consider Alternatives**: Show you've thought it through
- **Admit Tradeoffs**: Every design has downsides

### ‚ùå DON'T

- **Assume Context**: Explain like readers don't know the background
- **Skip Examples**: Code examples are crucial
- **Hide Drawbacks**: Be honest about limitations
- **Bikeshed**: Focus on substance over style
- **Be Vague**: "Make it better" isn't specific enough

## Example Structure (Minimal)

```markdown
# Proposal: [Your Idea]

## Abstract
[2-3 sentences explaining what you want to do]

## Problem
Right now, users can't [X] because [Y].
This causes [Z] pain points.

## Solution
I propose adding [feature] that works like this:

```typescript
// Clear code example
```

This solves the problem by [explanation].

## Why Not Just [Alternative]?
[Explain why alternatives don't work]

## Risks
- Risk 1: [mitigation]
- Risk 2: [mitigation]
```

That's it! You can expand from there.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should a proposal be?**
A: Long enough to be clear. Selective Module Inclusion is ~800 lines. Simple proposals can be 200 lines.

**Q: What if I'm not sure about the design?**
A: That's fine! Mark sections with `[DISCUSSION NEEDED]` and ask questions.

**Q: Do I need working code?**
A: No. Proposals come before implementation.

**Q: What if my proposal is rejected?**
A: You'll get clear feedback on why. You can revise and resubmit.

**Q: How long does review take?**
A: Minimum 7 days. Complex proposals may take 2-3 weeks.

**Q: Can I get early feedback?**
A: Yes! Open a GitHub Discussion or share a draft in team channels.

Good luck! üöÄ
