  name: "Dependency Injection Refactoring"
  description: "A technology-agnostic procedure for refactoring a function to use dependency injection (DI), making it easier to unit test."
  semantic: |
    This module provides a detailed, technology-agnostic procedure for refactoring a function to improve its testability by removing hard-coded dependencies and implementing the dependency injection (DI) pattern.
  deprecated: true

body:
  goal: |
    This procedure outlines the steps for refactoring a function to use dependency injection (DI), enhancing its testability.
  process:
    - "Identify the dependencies of the function."
    - "Modify the function signature to accept dependencies as parameters."
    - "Update the function implementation to use the injected dependencies."
    - "Create unit tests for the refactored function, using test doubles for the dependencies."
