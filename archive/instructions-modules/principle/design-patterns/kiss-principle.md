## Summary

The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones.
- **Clarity**: The code should be easy to read and understand.
- **Minimalism**: Avoid adding unnecessary features or logic.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Easier Maintenance**: Simple code is easier to understand, debug, and modify.
- **Faster Development**: Simple solutions are often quicker to implement.
- **Reduced Risk of Errors**: Fewer complex interactions mean fewer potential points of failure.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Over-simplification**: In some cases, a simple solution may not be sufficient to handle the complexity of a problem, leading to a system that is not robust or scalable.
- **Lack of Features**: A focus on simplicity might lead to the omission of features that are necessary for a complete user experience.
