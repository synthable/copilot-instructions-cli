## Summary

The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to objects dynamically without altering their structure. This pattern creates a decorator class that wraps the original class and provides additional functionality while maintaining the same interface, enabling flexible extension of object capabilities at runtime.

## Core Principles

- **Interface Preservation:** Decorators MUST implement the same interface as the objects they decorate, ensuring transparent substitutability and maintaining client expectations.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Decorators MUST use composition to wrap objects rather than inheritance, avoiding the limitations and complexity of deep inheritance hierarchies.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each decorator MUST add exactly one specific behavior or feature, maintaining clear separation of concerns and enabling fine-grained functionality composition.
- **Transparent Wrapping:** Decorators MUST delegate core functionality to the wrapped object while adding their specific behavior, preserving the original object's semantics.
- **Runtime Composition:** Multiple decorators MUST be combinable at runtime in any order to create complex behavior compositions without requiring pre-defined subclasses.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Dynamic Behavior Extension:** Enables adding or removing object behaviors at runtime without modifying existing code or creating numerous subclass combinations.
- **Flexible Feature Composition:** Allows combining multiple decorators in different orders to create various feature combinations without class explosion.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Supports extending object functionality without modifying existing classes, adhering to the open/closed principle of SOLID design.
- **Stream Processing:** Ideal for building processing pipelines where data flows through multiple transformation or enhancement stages.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Facilitates implementation of cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, security, or performance monitoring without polluting core business logic.
- **Legacy Code Enhancement:** Enables adding new features to existing objects without modifying their source code or breaking existing functionality.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Debugging Complexity:** Multiple layers of decoration can make debugging difficult as the execution flow passes through many wrapper objects.
- **Performance Overhead:** Each decorator adds method call overhead and object creation costs, potentially impacting performance in decorator-heavy scenarios.
- **Interface Dependency:** Changes to the core interface require updates to all decorator implementations, creating maintenance coupling.
- **Order Sensitivity:** The order of decorator application may affect behavior, requiring careful documentation and testing of decorator combinations.
- **Identity Confusion:** Decorated objects lose their original identity, potentially causing issues with object equality checks and type-specific operations.
