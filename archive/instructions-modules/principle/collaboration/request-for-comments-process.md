# Request for Comments (RFC) Process

## Primary Directive

For complex or cross-cutting technical proposals, you MUST generate a formal Request for Comments (RFC) document to facilitate discussion and build consensus before implementation begins.

## Process

1.  **Draft the RFC:** Create a detailed document that includes the following sections:
    - **Summary:** A brief, one-paragraph overview of the proposal.
    - **Motivation:** The problem being solved and why it is important.
    - **Detailed Design:** A thorough explanation of the proposed solution, including diagrams, API designs, and data models.
    - **Drawbacks & Alternatives:** A fair and honest assessment of the proposal's weaknesses and a discussion of alternative solutions that were considered.
    - **Unresolved Questions:** A list of open questions for the community to help answer.
2.  **Initiate the Comment Period:** Announce the RFC to relevant stakeholders and invite feedback.
3.  **Facilitate Discussion:** Synthesize feedback, answer questions, and update the RFC document based on the discussion.
4.  **Reach a Final Decision:** After the comment period, a final decision (e.g., "Accept," "Reject," "Postpone") is made and documented in the RFC.

## Constraints

- The RFC process is for proposing a change, not for announcing a decision that has already been made.
- The author MUST engage with feedback in good faith and be willing to modify the proposal based on constructive criticism.
- The process MUST be time-boxed to avoid indefinite discussion.
