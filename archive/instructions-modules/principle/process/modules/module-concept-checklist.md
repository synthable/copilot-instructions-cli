## Objective

To validate that a proposed module concept is well-defined, non-redundant, and adheres to the core philosophy of the instruction module system before proceeding with authoring.

## Items

- [ ] **Atomicity:** Does the concept represent a single, indivisible idea or process?
- [ ] **Clarity:** Is the goal of the concept unambiguous and clearly defined?
- [ ] **Tier Appropriateness:** Is the proposed `tier` (`foundation`, `principle`, `technology`, `execution`) a correct fit for the concept's scope and level of abstraction?
- [ ] **Non-Redundancy:** Does a module for this exact concept already exist in the library?
- [ ] **Value:** Does this module capture a reusable piece of knowledge or a process that will be valuable in multiple contexts?
