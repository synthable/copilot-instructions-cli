## Summary

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling the software to match the business domain. It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the domain.

## Core Principles

- **Ubiquitous Language**: A shared language used by all team members, both technical and non-technical.
- **Bounded Context**: A specific responsibility, with explicit boundaries that separate it from other parts of the system.
- **Domain Model**: A conceptual model of the business domain.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Improved Communication**: The ubiquitous language fosters better communication and understanding between developers and domain experts.
- **Better Alignment with Business Needs**: The software is more likely to meet the needs of the business.
- **Increased Flexibility**: A well-designed domain model can be more easily adapted to changing business requirements.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **High Learning Curve**: DDD requires a significant investment in learning and understanding the principles.
- **Complexity**: DDD can be overkill for simple applications.
- **Requires Domain Experts**: The success of DDD depends on having access to and collaboration with domain experts.
