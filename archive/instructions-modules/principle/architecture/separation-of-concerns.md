## Summary

The Separation of Concerns principle advocates for dividing a system into distinct, independent sections, each responsible for a specific function or feature. This approach creates cleaner abstractions and simplifies development and maintenance.

## Core Principles

- **Functional Decomposition**: Break down the system based on its core functionalities (e.g., user interface, business logic, data access).
- **Encapsulation**: Each section should hide its internal complexity from other sections, exposing only a well-defined interface.
- **Low Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between different sections to reduce the impact of changes.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to one section are less likely to affect others, making the system easier to update.
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Self-contained sections with specific responsibilities are easier to reuse in different contexts.
- **Parallel Development**: Different teams can work on different sections simultaneously with minimal interference.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Increased Complexity**: Over-separation can lead to a fragmented system that is difficult to understand and manage.
- **Performance Overhead**: Communication between highly separated sections can introduce latency.
