## Summary

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm where components communicate through the production and consumption of events. This enables loose coupling and high scalability, making it well-suited for asynchronous systems and complex workflows.

## Core Principles

- **Events**: An event is a significant change in state.
- **Producers**: Components that produce events.
- **Consumers**: Components that consume and react to events.
- **Event Channel**: The medium through which events are transmitted (e.g., a message queue).

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Loose Coupling**: Producers and consumers are decoupled and do not need to know about each other.
- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Allows for non-blocking, asynchronous workflows.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Complexity**: The asynchronous nature of the architecture can make it difficult to debug and reason about.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across different services can be challenging.
- **Event Ordering**: Guaranteeing the order of events can be difficult in a distributed system.
