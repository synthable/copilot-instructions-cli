## Summary

Serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure. Developers can build and run applications without having to manage servers. This allows for greater scalability and can reduce operational costs.

## Core Principles

- **No Server Management**: Developers do not need to provision or manage servers.
- **Pay-per-use**: You only pay for the resources you consume.
- **Automatic Scaling**: The cloud provider automatically scales the application in response to demand.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Reduced Operational Costs**: No need to manage servers, which can reduce operational overhead.
- **Scalability**: Applications can scale automatically to handle changes in traffic.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Developers can focus on writing code instead of managing infrastructure.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Vendor Lock-in**: It can be difficult to switch cloud providers.
- **Cold Starts**: There can be a delay in responding to the first request after a period of inactivity.
- **Limited Execution Duration**: Serverless functions often have a maximum execution time.
