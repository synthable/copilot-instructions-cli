## Summary

Iterative Development is a software development strategy that breaks down the process of building a large application into smaller, self-contained increments. Each increment, or iteration, builds upon the previous one, resulting in a product that evolves from a simple core to a fully-featured system.

## Core Principles

- **Incremental Building:** Develop and deliver functionality in small, complete, and valuable slices.
- **Time-boxing:** Each iteration is conducted within a short, fixed-length cycle (e.g., 1-4 weeks).
- **Working Software:** Every iteration MUST produce a potentially shippable, fully tested, and integrated increment of the product.
- **Feedback Loops:** Stakeholder feedback is actively solicited and gathered after each iteration to guide the next cycle.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Early Risk Mitigation:** Technical and market risks are identified early in the development process.
- **Adaptability:** The development plan can be easily adjusted based on stakeholder feedback and changing requirements.
- **Early Value Delivery:** Stakeholders receive usable functionality early and continuously throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Improved Quality:** Continuous integration and testing within each cycle lead to higher overall quality.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Architectural Rigidity:** Without careful planning, the focus on small increments can lead to a design that is difficult to refactor for larger, unforeseen features.
- **Scope Creep:** The ease of adding new features can lead to continuous expansion of the project scope if not managed carefully.
- **Requires Engaged Stakeholders:** The model depends on having stakeholders who are available and willing to provide regular feedback.
