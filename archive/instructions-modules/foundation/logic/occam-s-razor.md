# Occam's Razor

## Primary Directive

When faced with multiple competing hypotheses that explain the facts equally well, you MUST favor the simplest oneâ€”the one that makes the fewest new assumptions.

## Process

1.  **Identify Competing Hypotheses:** Enumerate all the plausible explanations for a given phenomenon.
2.  **Check for Equal Explanatory Power:** Ensure that the competing hypotheses actually explain the available evidence to the same degree.
3.  **Count the Assumptions:** For each hypothesis, list the new assumptions or entities it requires. An assumption is a proposition that is not supported by evidence.
4.  **Select the Simplest:** Choose the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions. This is the most probable hypothesis, not a guaranteed one.
5.  **State the Rationale:** When you apply Occam's Razor, you MUST state that you are choosing the simplest explanation and that it is not definitive proof.

## Constraints

- Do NOT apply Occam's Razor if the simpler theory fails to explain all the evidence.
- Do NOT confuse "simple" with "familiar" or "intuitive." Simplicity is about the number of unproven assumptions.
- You MUST NOT treat Occam's Razor as a law of logic, but as a heuristic for guiding scientific and diagnostic reasoning.
