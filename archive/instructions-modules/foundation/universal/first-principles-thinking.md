## Core Concept

First principles thinking requires decomposing any complex problem or proposition into its most basic, indisputable components and reconstructing understanding from these fundamental truths, rather than relying on assumptions, analogies, or conventional wisdom.

## Key Rules

- **Assumption Inventory:** You MUST identify and catalog all assumptions, conventions, and beliefs embedded in a problem statement, explicitly distinguishing between empirically verifiable facts and unverified conventional practices.
- **Recursive Validation:** You MUST systematically question the validity of each identified assumption by demanding evidence and continuing to ask "why" until you reach bedrock facts that cannot be further reduced.
- **First Principle Classification:** You MUST extract irreducible truths that cannot be further decomposed. These are the foundational building blocks of your reasoning.
- **Foundation-Based Reconstruction:** You MUST build your final understanding or solution using exclusively the verified fundamental principles, ensuring each step in your reasoning derives directly from these foundational truths.
- **Reconstruction Validation:** You MUST verify that your final conclusion relies exclusively on the identified first principles and does not implicitly reintroduce any of the original, unverified assumptions.
- **Principle-Conclusion Distinction:** You MUST explicitly differentiate between the fundamental principles (the premises) and the derived conclusions throughout the analysis process.

## Best Practices

- **Inventory All Assumptions:** Create a comprehensive list of every assumption, convention, and belief. For each, ask: "What is being accepted as true without direct evidence?"
- **Apply Recursive Questioning:** For each assumption, systematically question its validity by asking: "Why is this true?", "What evidence supports this?", and "What would happen if this were false?"
- **Identify Irreducible Truths:** Extract the fundamental principles from your analysis. These are typically:
  - Laws of physics or mathematics.
  - Empirically verified, measurable facts.
  - Logical axioms that cannot be disputed.
- **Reconstruct from Foundations:** Build your understanding step-by-step using ONLY the verified first principles.
- **Validate the Reconstruction:** Ensure your final solution relies exclusively on the identified first principles.
- **Question Established Practices:** Examine the underlying rationale and evidence base for any "best practice" or conventional approach.
- **Decompose Complex Systems:** Break down systems to their fundamental components and interactions to understand their core mechanics.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Conventional Wisdom Acceptance:** Adopting established practices or popular approaches without examining their underlying rationale and evidence base.
- **Analogy-Based Reasoning:** Making decisions based on superficial similarities to other situations rather than analyzing the fundamental requirements and constraints of the current problem.
- **Evidence-Free Assumptions:** Proceeding with a line of reasoning when its foundational premises cannot be verified.
- **Principle-Conclusion Confusion:** Mixing fundamental truths with derived conclusions within the same logical step.
- **Context-Free Application:** Applying general principles without considering the specific constraints, requirements, or environmental factors of the problem at hand.
- **Authority-Based Acceptance:** Accepting a conclusion as true solely because of the credibility of the source, without examining the underlying evidence and reasoning.
