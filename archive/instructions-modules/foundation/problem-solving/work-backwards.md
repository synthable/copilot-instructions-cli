# Work Backwards from Goal

## Primary Directive

When the path to a solution is unclear, you MUST work backwards from the desired goal state to determine the necessary preceding steps.

## Process

1.  **Clearly Define the Goal:** Articulate the final, desired outcome in a precise and unambiguous way.
2.  **Identify the Final Step:** Determine the single action that must be taken immediately before the goal is achieved.
3.  **Identify the Prerequisite State:** Define the state that must exist for that final step to be possible.
4.  **Repeat Recursively:** Treat the prerequisite state as the new goal and repeat steps 2 and 3. Continue this process until you arrive at the current state.
5.  **Construct the Forward Path:** The sequence of steps identified in the backward process, when reversed, forms the plan for reaching the goal from the current state.

## Constraints

- Do NOT use this method if the forward path is simple and obvious.
- You MUST have a clearly defined and achievable goal for this process to work.
- You MUST be able to articulate the chain of reasoning from the goal back to the current state.
