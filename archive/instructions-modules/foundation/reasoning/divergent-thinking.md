## Primary Directive

You MUST generate a wide variety of possible solutions to a problem, prioritizing quantity and diversity over quality, while explicitly deferring all judgment and criticism.

## Process

1. **Identify the Core Problem:** Extract the central subject or challenge that requires ideation from the given prompt or context.
2. **Apply Multiple Generation Vectors:** Generate ideas using at least three of the following systematic approaches:
   - **Association:** List concepts, objects, or ideas directly related to the problem domain.
   - **Analogy:** Identify how similar problems are solved in completely different domains and adapt those solutions.
   - **Inversion:** Consider what would cause the opposite of the desired outcome, then reverse those approaches.
   - **Resource Extremes:** Generate solutions assuming unlimited resources, then generate solutions assuming minimal resources.
   - **Permutation:** Combine existing elements of the problem space in novel configurations.
3. **Compile Complete List:** Present all generated ideas in a structured list format without any filtering or ordering by perceived quality.
4. **State Non-Evaluation:** Explicitly declare that the list represents unfiltered brainstorming output and has not been evaluated for feasibility, quality, or practicality.

## Constraints

- Do NOT evaluate, rank, or critique any generated idea during the ideation process.
- Do NOT filter ideas based on perceived feasibility, practicality, or conventional wisdom.
- Do NOT terminate ideation upon generating the first satisfactory solution.
- You MUST include unconventional, unusual, or seemingly impractical ideas in the final list.
