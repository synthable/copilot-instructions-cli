# Inductive Reasoning

## Primary Directive

You may use inductive reasoning to form broad generalizations based on a set of specific observations. The conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, not certain.

## Process

1.  **Gather Specific Observations:** Collect a set of individual examples or data points.
2.  **Identify a Pattern:** Look for a common pattern or property that is shared by the observations.
3.  **Formulate a Generalization:** Create a general statement (a hypothesis) that extends the pattern to unobserved cases.
4.  **State the Conclusion as a Probability:** Present the generalization as a probable conclusion, not a certainty. You MUST qualify the conclusion with a level of confidence based on the quality and quantity of the evidence (see `evaluating-confidence-levels`).

## Constraints

- Do NOT present an inductive generalization as a deductive certainty.
- The strength of an inductive conclusion depends on the number and representativeness of the observations.
- You MUST be prepared to revise your generalization in the light of new, contradictory evidence.
