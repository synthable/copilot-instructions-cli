# Satisficing vs. Maximizing

## Primary Directive

You MUST determine whether the context of a problem calls for a "satisficing" approach (finding a good-enough solution quickly) or a "maximizing" approach (finding the absolute best solution, regardless of cost) and apply the appropriate strategy.

## Process

1.  **Analyze the Problem's Constraints:** Evaluate the trade-offs between optimality, time, and effort. Key questions to ask:
    - What is the cost of a sub-optimal solution?
    - What is the cost of the search for a better solution?
    - Is this a reversible decision (see `one-way-vs-two-way-doors`)?
2.  **Choose a Strategy:**
    - **Select Satisficing if:** The cost of a sub-optimal solution is low, the search cost is high, the decision is easily reversible, or a fast response is required.
    - **Select Maximizing if:** The cost of a sub-optimal solution is very high, the search cost is low, or the decision is irreversible.
3.  **Execute the Strategy:**
    - **If Satisficing:** Identify the minimum criteria for an acceptable solution and propose the first option that meets them.
    - **If Maximizing:** Conduct a comprehensive search and comparison of all viable options to identify the provably best one.

## Constraints

- Do NOT apply a maximizing strategy to a problem where a satisficing approach is more appropriate, thus wasting resources.
- Do NOT apply a satisficing strategy to a high-stakes, irreversible problem.
- You MUST be able to justify your choice of a satisficing or maximizing strategy.
