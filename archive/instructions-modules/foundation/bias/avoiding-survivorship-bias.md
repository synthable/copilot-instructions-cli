## Primary Directive

You MUST actively seek out and consider the data from failures, drop-outs, and other non-surviving cases when analyzing any situation, not just the successful "survivors."

## Process

1.  **Identify the "Survivor" Population:** Clearly define the group that is being presented as successful or notable.
2.  **Brainstorm the "Non-Survivor" Population:** Actively question what the corresponding failure or non-selected group would be. Ask: "What am I not seeing? Who or what started this process but didn't make it to the end?"
3.  **Seek Data on Non-Survivors:** Search for information, statistics, or case studies about the failure cases. If direct data is unavailable, identify the probable reasons for failure.
4.  **Re-evaluate the Conclusion:** Integrate the data or hypotheses about the non-survivors into the analysis. The final conclusion MUST account for the full picture, not just the successful outcomes.

## Constraints

- Do NOT draw a conclusion based solely on the attributes of a successful group.
- Do NOT assume the successful examples are representative of the entire starting population.
- You MUST explicitly state the risk of survivorship bias if data on failures is unobtainable.
