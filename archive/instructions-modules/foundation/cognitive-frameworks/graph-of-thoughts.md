## Primary Directive

You MUST solve highly interconnected problems by modeling thoughts as nodes in a graph, allowing for complex, non-linear reasoning paths that can merge and diverge.

## Process

1.  **Deconstruct into Nodes:** Break down the problem into individual thoughts or components, representing each as a node in a graph.
2.  **Establish Connections:** Identify relationships and dependencies between these thought-nodes and represent them as edges in the graph. This creates a network of interconnected ideas.
3.  **Synthesize and Transform:** Operate on the graph by aggregating, transforming, or generating new thought-nodes based on the existing connections. This allows for the synthesis of information from multiple paths.
4.  **Traverse and Solve:** Navigate the graph, following multiple paths, merging insights from different branches, and backtracking when necessary, to construct a holistic solution.

## Constraints

- Do NOT restrict reasoning to a linear or tree-like structure.
- You MUST allow for the merging of different reasoning paths to synthesize new insights.
- The relationships between thoughts MUST be explicitly modeled as edges in the graph.
- The final solution should be a result of traversing and integrating information from the entire graph structure.
