# Potential Vitest Modules

This document outlines potential new modules to expand the Vitest testing guidance in the instructions-composer system.

## Core Testing Concepts

- **vitest-configuration.md** - Setting up vitest.config.ts with proper TypeScript, coverage, and environment configuration
- **test-organization.md** - Structuring test files, naming conventions, and test suite organization
- **async-testing.md** - Testing promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations
- **error-testing.md** - Testing error conditions, exception handling, and failure scenarios

## Advanced Testing Patterns

- **test-utilities.md** - Creating reusable test helpers, factories, and custom matchers
- **parameterized-testing.md** - Using test.each() and describe.each() for data-driven tests
- **snapshot-testing.md** - Effective use of snapshots for UI components and data structures
- **concurrent-testing.md** - Parallel test execution strategies and considerations

## Environment & Setup

- **test-environment-setup.md** - Managing test environments (jsdom, node, happy-dom)
- **global-setup-teardown.md** - Using globalSetup and globalTeardown for test infrastructure
- **test-fixtures.md** - Creating and managing test data and fixtures
- **browser-testing.md** - Using @vitest/browser for browser environment testing

## Integration & Mocking

- **module-mocking-strategies.md** - Advanced patterns for mocking modules and dependencies
- **api-testing.md** - Testing HTTP clients, API calls, and network requests
- **database-testing.md** - Testing database interactions with proper isolation
- **file-system-testing.md** - Mocking and testing file system operations

## Coverage & Quality

- **coverage-configuration.md** - Setting up and interpreting test coverage reports
- **test-debugging.md** - Debugging failing tests and using Vitest's debugging features
- **flaky-test-prevention.md** - Identifying and preventing non-deterministic test failures
- **test-performance-optimization.md** - Optimizing test execution speed and resource usage

## TypeScript Integration

- **typescript-testing.md** - Type-safe testing patterns and TypeScript-specific considerations
- **type-testing.md** - Testing TypeScript types and type guards
- **generic-testing.md** - Testing generic functions and components

## UI & Component Testing

- **component-testing-setup.md** - Setting up Vitest for component testing
- **dom-testing.md** - Testing DOM manipulation and user interactions
- **event-testing.md** - Testing event handlers and user input scenarios

## Specialized Testing

- **worker-testing.md** - Testing Web Workers and service workers
- **performance-testing.md** - Basic performance testing and benchmarking with Vitest
- **visual-regression-testing.md** - Setting up visual regression tests
- **accessibility-testing.md** - Testing accessibility features and compliance

## Summary

These 24 potential modules would significantly expand the Vitest guidance, covering:

- Configuration and setup
- Advanced testing patterns
- TypeScript integration
- UI and component testing
- Specialized testing scenarios

The proposals fill gaps not covered by the existing 5 modules (best-practices.md, mocking-with-vi.md, mocking.md, performance.md, timers-and-fakes.md).
