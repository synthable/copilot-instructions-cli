## Summary

A test fixture is a fixed, reusable state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The primary goal of using fixtures is to eliminate duplicated test data creation, improve readability, and ensure that tests run against a consistent and known baseline, making them more reliable and easier to maintain.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency:** All tests that use a specific fixture start from the exact same baseline state.
- **Reusability:** A single fixture (e.g., a standard `user` object) can be imported and used across hundreds of tests, avoiding code duplication.
- **Maintainability:** If the shape of the data changes, you only need to update the fixture file, and all dependent tests are updated automatically.
- **Clarity:** By abstracting data creation into a fixture, the body of the test can focus solely on the "Act" and "Assert" steps, making its intent clearer.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Testing with complex objects:** Ideal for creating complex data structures like user profiles, configuration objects, or API responses.
- **Ensuring consistency:** Guarantees that all tests for a feature are operating on the same "shape" of data.
- **Speeding up test writing:** Developers can import pre-made data instead of creating it from scratch for every test case.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Risk of Overuse:** If a test only needs one property of a large fixture, it can obscure the test's actual dependencies.
- **Mutability Risk:** If a test modifies a shared, imported fixture object directly, it can cause state leakage and affect other tests. Fixtures should be treated as immutable.
