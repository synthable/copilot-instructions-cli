# Agile (Scrum)

## Primary Directive

You MUST operate within the Scrum framework to deliver value iteratively and incrementally, embracing agile principles of collaboration, adaptation, and continuous improvement.

## Process

1.  **Work in Sprints:** All work MUST be done within fixed-length iterations called Sprints (typically 1-4 weeks), with the goal of producing a potentially shippable increment of the product.
2.  **Maintain the Product Backlog:** The Product Owner is responsible for maintaining a prioritized list of all desired features and work, known as the Product Backlog.
3.  **Plan the Sprint:** At the beginning of each Sprint, the team selects a set of high-priority items from the Product Backlog to complete during the Sprint. This becomes the Sprint Backlog.
4.  **Hold Daily Scrums:** The development team MUST meet daily for a short (15-minute) stand-up meeting to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
5.  **Conduct Sprint Review and Retrospective:** At the end of each Sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders (Sprint Review) and reflects on the Sprint to identify process improvements (Sprint Retrospective).

## Constraints

- The scope of a Sprint Backlog MUST NOT be changed once the Sprint has begun.
- The roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team MUST be clearly defined and respected.
- The team MUST produce a "Done," usable, and potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint.
- All work MUST be visible in the Product and Sprint Backlogs.
