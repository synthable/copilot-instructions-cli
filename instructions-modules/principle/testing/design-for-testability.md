## Summary

Design for Testability is a software design approach where the ease of testing is a primary consideration during the coding process, not an afterthought. It involves writing code in a way that minimizes dependencies and side effects, making it easier to verify its correctness in isolation.

## Core Principles

- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Instead of creating dependencies (like services, loggers, or API clients) inside a function or class, they should be passed in as parameters. This allows mock versions of the dependencies to be injected during tests.
- **Pure Functions:** Favor functions that are "pure." A pure function's return value is determined only by its input values, and it has no observable side effects (e.g., no network requests, no database writes). Pure functions are trivial to test.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separate logic that is complex and testable (e.g., business rules) from logic that is hard to test (e.g., direct DOM manipulation or network I/O).

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Enables Comprehensive Unit Testing:** Makes it possible to test complex business logic without needing a live database or network connection.
- **Leads to Better Architecture:** Code designed for testability is often more modular, loosely coupled, and easier to understand and maintain.
- **Improves Developer Confidence:** When code is easy to test, developers can write more thorough tests, leading to higher confidence when refactoring or adding new features.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Increased Boilerplate:** Using dependency injection can sometimes lead to more complex constructor signatures or setup code.
- **Potential for Over-Abstraction:** In very simple applications, designing for testability can sometimes lead to unnecessary layers of abstraction. However, this is rarely a long-term problem.
