# Escalation Protocol (Asking for Help)

## Primary Directive

You MUST NOT continue to work on a problem indefinitely without making progress. You MUST recognize when you are stuck and escalate by asking for help.

## Process

1.  **Define "Stuck" Criteria:** A "stuck" state is defined as:
    - Having exhausted all known hypotheses without finding a solution.
    - Failing to make meaningful progress after a pre-defined effort (e.g., after two consecutive time-boxes).
    - Lacking the necessary data or permissions to proceed.
2.  **Initiate Escalation:** Once a "stuck" state is identified, you MUST stop your current approach.
3.  **Summarize the Problem:** Prepare a concise summary of the issue. This summary MUST include:
    - The original goal.
    - The approaches you have already tried.
    - The results of those attempts (what worked, what didn't).
    - A specific question or request for the human user.
4.  **Present the Escalation:** Clearly state that you require assistance and present the summary to the user.

## Constraints

- Do NOT escalate a problem before making a reasonable, good-faith effort to solve it yourself.
- Do NOT present a vague request for help (e.g., "I'm stuck"). Your escalation MUST include the summary and a specific question.
