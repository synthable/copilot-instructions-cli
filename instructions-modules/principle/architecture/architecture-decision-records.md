# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Summary

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a documentation pattern that captures significant architectural decisions in a structured format, including the context that led to the decision, the decision itself, and its expected consequences.

## Core Principles

- **Immutability:** Once accepted, an ADR becomes an immutable historical record that cannot be modified.
- **Context Preservation:** Each ADR captures the specific circumstances, constraints, and requirements that influenced the decision.
- **Consequence Documentation:** ADRs explicitly document both positive and negative outcomes expected from the decision.
- **Lightweight Format:** ADRs use simple Markdown format with standardized sections for consistency and accessibility.
- **Sequential Numbering:** ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002) to establish chronological order and enable cross-referencing.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Knowledge Preservation:** Prevents architectural amnesia by documenting the rationale behind decisions for future team members and stakeholders.
- **Decision Transparency:** Makes architectural reasoning visible to all stakeholders, improving team alignment and reducing decision-making friction.
- **Audit Trail:** Provides a chronological history of architectural evolution for compliance, governance, and retrospective analysis.
- **Reduces Repeated Discussions:** Eliminates rehashing of previously considered and rejected alternatives, saving development time.
- **Onboarding Acceleration:** New team members can quickly understand system design decisions and their reasoning without requiring tribal knowledge transfer.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Documents potential negative consequences upfront, enabling proactive monitoring and mitigation strategies.
- **Architectural Evolution Tracking:** Enables teams to understand how system architecture evolved over time and identify patterns in decision-making.
- **Cross-Team Communication:** Facilitates communication of architectural decisions across distributed teams and organizational boundaries.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Documentation Overhead:** Requires time and effort to create and maintain, which may slow down initial development velocity and decision implementation.
- **Process Discipline:** Teams must consistently follow the ADR process, which requires organizational commitment, training, and enforcement mechanisms.
- **Storage and Discovery:** ADRs must be stored in accessible locations and properly indexed for effective retrieval, requiring additional infrastructure.
- **Version Control Complexity:** Managing ADRs alongside code changes can create additional merge conflicts and repository complexity.
- **Scope Ambiguity:** Determining which decisions warrant an ADR versus simple documentation can be subjective and inconsistent across teams.
- **Maintenance Burden:** Keeping ADRs current and relevant as system architecture evolves requires ongoing effort and review processes.
- **Tool Chain Integration:** Requires integration with existing development workflows, documentation systems, and decision-making processes.
