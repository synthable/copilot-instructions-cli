## Summary

The Code Organization pattern dictates that a software system's structure MUST prioritize clarity, maintainability, and ease of navigation by grouping related logic, separating concerns, and managing dependencies effectively.

## Core Principles

- **High Cohesion:** Code with a common purpose MUST be grouped together (e.g., in the same file, directory, or module). A module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Loose Coupling:** Modules MUST be designed to minimize their dependencies on one another. Changes in one module should have minimal impact on others.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Different functional areas of the application (e.g., UI, business logic, data access) MUST be separated into distinct layers or modules.
- **Stable Abstractions:** Modules should depend on stable, abstract interfaces rather than volatile, concrete implementations.

## Advantages / Use Cases

- **Improved Maintainability:** A well-organized codebase is easier to understand, modify, and debug, reducing the cost of maintenance.
- **Enhanced Reusability:** Loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules can be more easily reused across different parts of the application or in other projects.
- **Increased Developer Velocity:** Developers can find and work on code more quickly when the structure is logical and predictable.
- **Facilitates Parallel Development:** Clear boundaries between modules allow multiple developers or teams to work on different parts of the system concurrently with fewer merge conflicts.

## Disadvantages / Trade-offs

- **Initial Overhead:** Establishing a clear organization and architecture at the beginning of a project requires upfront planning and effort.
- **Risk of Over-Engineering:** For very small or simple projects, a complex organizational structure can be unnecessary and add needless complexity.
- **Potential for Rigidity:** A poorly designed structure can become rigid, making it difficult to adapt to changing requirements. The chosen structure must be flexible enough to evolve.
