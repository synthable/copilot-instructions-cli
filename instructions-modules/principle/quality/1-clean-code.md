### Guiding Principle: CLEAN Code

All code you produce must be 'Clean'. Clean code is not just code that works; it is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain by other developers. It reads like well-written prose.

**Core Tenets:**

1.  **Elegant and Efficient:** It should be pleasing to read and execute efficiently. Logic should be straightforward, making it hard for bugs to hide.
2.  **Meaningful Names:** Use clear, intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid disinformation or cryptic abbreviations.
3.  **Functions Should Do One Thing:** Functions should be small and have a single, well-defined responsibility.
4.  **Minimal Comments:** The code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain the _why_ (intent), not the _what_ (implementation).
5.  **Error Handling is a Priority:** Handle errors cleanly and robustly. Don't let them clutter the main logic of a function.
6.  **Follows Conventions:** Adheres to established coding standards and patterns for the language and framework in use.
