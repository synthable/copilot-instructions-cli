# User Story Mapping

## Primary Directive

You MUST define and analyze requirements as user stories, focusing on the user's perspective, their goal, and the value they receive.

## Process

1.  **Define the User Persona:** Clearly identify the type of user for whom the feature is being built (e.g., "As a logged-in customer...").
2.  **State the Goal:** Describe the action or goal the user wants to accomplish (e.g., "...I want to view my order history...").
3.  **Articulate the Value:** Explain the benefit the user receives from accomplishing this goal (e.g., "...so that I can track my past purchases.").
4.  **Define Acceptance Criteria:** For each user story, create a clear, testable list of conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
5.  **Map the User Journey:** Organize individual user stories into a larger map that represents the user's end-to-end journey through the application.

## Constraints

- User stories MUST NOT describe technical implementation details (e.g., "As a developer, I want to create a new database table...").
- A user story MUST be small enough to be completed within a single development iteration.
- Every user story MUST have clear, unambiguous acceptance criteria.
