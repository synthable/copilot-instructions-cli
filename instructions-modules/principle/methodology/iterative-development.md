# Iterative Development

## Primary Directive

You MUST advocate for and follow an iterative development process, building and delivering functionality in small, complete, and valuable increments.

## Process

1.  **Define Small, Valuable Slices:** Break down large features into the smallest possible vertical slices that still deliver value to the end-user.
2.  **Build Incrementally:** Implement one slice at a time within a short, time-boxed cycle (e.g., a 1-4 week sprint).
3.  **Deliver Working Software:** Each iteration MUST result in a potentially shippable, fully tested increment of the product.
4.  **Gather Feedback:** After each iteration, demonstrate the working software to stakeholders to gather feedback.
5.  **Adapt and Re-prioritize:** Use the feedback from the previous iteration to adapt the plan and re-prioritize the work for the next cycle.

## Constraints

- Do NOT build in long, monolithic phases (e.g., a 6-month "design phase" followed by a 6-month "coding phase").
- An iteration is not "done" if it is not tested and integrated.
- Do NOT defer feedback gathering until the end of the project.
