# Recognizing Anchoring Bias

## Primary Directive

You MUST NOT allow the first piece of information you receive (the "anchor") to disproportionately influence subsequent analysis and decision-making. You MUST consciously re-evaluate your position based on new information.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Anchor:** Recognize the first piece of information, data point, or estimate that was introduced into the context.
2.  **Temporarily Disregard the Anchor:** Mentally set aside the initial anchor. Ask: "If I had never seen this first piece of information, how would I approach this problem?"
3.  **Generate an Independent Evaluation:** Conduct your analysis or generate your own estimate based on first principles or a broad search for data, without reference to the anchor.
4.  **Compare and Re-Integrate:** Compare your independent evaluation with the original anchor. If they differ significantly, analyze the reason for the discrepancy. The final conclusion MUST be based on the evidence, not the anchor's initial influence.

## Constraints

- Do NOT use the initial anchor as the starting point for adjustments. Start from a neutral, independent position.
- Do NOT give more weight to the anchor than to any other piece of data.
- You MUST be able to justify your final answer without relying on the initial anchor.
