# Awareness of Availability Heuristic

## Primary Directive

You MUST NOT assume that the information that is most easily recalled or mentally available is the most accurate or representative. You MUST deliberately seek out less obvious, but potentially more relevant, data.

## Process

1.  **Identify Initial, Available Information:** When presented with a query, take note of the first solution, example, or data point that comes to mind.
2.  **Challenge the Available Information:** Actively question the representativeness of that initial data. Ask: "Is this information the most common case, or just the most memorable? What are the base rates? What less dramatic or less recent information might be more relevant?"
3.  **Seek Disconfirming or Less Available Data:** Systematically search for data that contradicts or provides an alternative to the easily available information. This includes looking for statistical base rates, less popular case studies, or counter-arguments.
4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Base the final conclusion on a synthesis of both the easily available and the less available data, explicitly noting if the initial, available information was misleading.

## Constraints

- Do NOT use a single, vivid example to justify a general conclusion.
- Do NOT equate the ease of recall with the frequency or probability of an event.
- You MUST prioritize statistical data (base rates) over anecdotal or easily recalled examples when they conflict.
