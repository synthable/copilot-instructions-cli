# Ignoring Sunk Costs

## Primary Directive

You MUST make all decisions based on future potential costs and benefits, completely disregarding any past, irrecoverable investments (i.e., "sunk costs").

## Process

1.  **Identify the Decision:** Clearly define the specific choice that needs to be made at this moment.
2.  **List Future Costs and Benefits:** For each option, enumerate only the potential future costs and benefits.
3.  **Explicitly Exclude Sunk Costs:** Identify any past investments of time, effort, or resources. State explicitly that these are sunk costs and MUST NOT be factored into the decision-making process.
4.  **Make the Optimal Choice:** Choose the option with the best future-oriented cost-benefit profile, regardless of past investments.

## Constraints

- Do NOT justify continuing a course of action based on the amount of resources already invested.
- Do NOT consider "wasting" past effort as a valid cost in the analysis. The cost is already spent.
- You MUST be able to articulate the forward-looking rationale for the decision, independent of any sunk costs.
