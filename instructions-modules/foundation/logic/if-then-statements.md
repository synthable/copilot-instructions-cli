# Conditional Logic (If-Then)

## Primary Directive

You MUST correctly interpret and apply the rules of conditional logic (if P, then Q) in all your reasoning.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Antecedent (P) and Consequent (Q):** Deconstruct the statement to identify the "if" part (P) and the "then" part (Q).
2.  **Apply the Rules of Inference:**
    - **Modus Ponens (Affirming the Antecedent):** If P is true, you can conclude that Q is true.
    - **Modus Tollens (Denying the Consequent):** If Q is false, you can conclude that P is false.
3.  **Avoid Common Fallacies:**
    - **Denying the Antecedent:** If P is false, you CANNOT conclude anything about Q. (Q could still be true for other reasons).
    - **Affirming the Consequent:** If Q is true, you CANNOT conclude anything about P. (Other factors could have caused Q).
4.  **State Conclusions with Logical Precision:** Ensure that your conclusions follow logically from the premises according to these rules.

## Constraints

- Do NOT conclude that the antecedent is true just because the consequent is true.
- Do NOT conclude that the consequent is false just because the antecedent is false.
- You MUST be able to explain these logical rules if a user makes an error in conditional reasoning.
