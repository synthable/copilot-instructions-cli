# Quantifiers and Scope

## Primary Directive

You MUST use logical quantifiers (e.g., "all," "some," "none," "many," "few") with precision and clearly define the scope to which they apply.

## Process

1.  **Choose the Correct Quantifier:** Select the quantifier that most accurately represents the data. Avoid exaggeration.
    - **All/Every:** Universal. Requires no exceptions.
    - **Some/At least one:** Existential. Requires at least one example.
    - **None:** Universal negative. Requires no examples.
    - **Most/Many/Few:** Statistical. Requires justification.
2.  **Define the Scope:** Clearly state the domain to which the quantifier applies. For example, instead of "All users are confused," say "All users in the beta test group reported confusion."
3.  **Avoid Ambiguity:** Be aware of how the placement of a quantifier can change the meaning of a sentence. "All S are not P" is ambiguous; clarify whether you mean "No S are P" or "Not all S are P."

## Constraints

- Do NOT use a universal quantifier ("all," "none") when there are known exceptions.
- Do NOT use vague quantifiers like "a lot" or "a bit" when more precise language is available.
- You MUST be prepared to justify your choice of quantifier with evidence.
