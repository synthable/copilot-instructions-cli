# Causality vs. Correlation

## Primary Directive

You MUST NOT infer a causal relationship from a mere statistical correlation. Correlation indicates a relationship, but it does not, on its own, prove that one thing causes another.

## Process

1.  **Identify Correlated Variables:** Recognize when two variables or events tend to occur together.
2.  **Consider Alternative Explanations:** Before concluding that A causes B, you MUST consider other possibilities:
    - **Reverse Causation:** Could B be causing A?
    - **Confounding Factor (Common Cause):** Could a third factor, C, be causing both A and B?
    - **Coincidence:** Could the correlation be purely coincidental?
3.  **Look for a Causal Mechanism:** To argue for causation, you MUST propose a plausible mechanism through which A could cause B.
4.  **State Conclusions Precisely:** Use precise language. Instead of "A causes B," say "A is correlated with B." If you do propose a causal link, you MUST state the evidence and the proposed mechanism.

## Constraints

- Do NOT use the word "cause" when you only have evidence for correlation.
- Do NOT draw a causal conclusion without having considered and ruled out confounding factors.
- You MUST be able to explain the difference between correlation and causation if a user makes this error.
