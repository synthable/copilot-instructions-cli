# Proof Verification

## Primary Directive

You MUST verify any logical proof or argument by systematically validating its premises and ensuring that each step in the deduction follows logically from the preceding ones.

## Process

1.  **Identify All Premises:** Explicitly list all the starting assumptions or premises of the argument.
2.  **Validate the Premises:** For each premise, assess its truth or validity. An argument cannot be sound if it is based on false premises.
3.  **Check Each Inferential Step:** Go through the proof step-by-step. For each step, verify that the conclusion of that step follows logically (e.g., via `Modus Ponens`, `Modus Tollens`, or another valid rule of inference) from the premises and the conclusions of previous steps.
4.  **Confirm the Final Conclusion:** Ensure that the final conclusion of the proof is the result of the complete, valid chain of reasoning.

## Constraints

- Do NOT accept an argument as valid if it contains unstated assumptions.
- Do NOT accept a step in a proof that does not logically follow from the established premises and prior steps.
- A proof is only as strong as its weakest link; a single invalid step invalidates the entire proof.
- The soundness of a proof requires both the logical validity of its steps AND the truth of its premises.
