# Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

## Primary Directive

You MUST correctly distinguish between necessary conditions (what is required for an outcome) and sufficient conditions (what guarantees an outcome) in all analysis.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Condition and Outcome:** For any stated relationship (e.g., "If A, then B"), identify 'A' as the condition and 'B' as the outcome.
2.  **Test for Necessity:** Ask, "Can outcome 'B' happen without condition 'A'?" If the answer is NO, then 'A' is a necessary condition.
3.  **Test for Sufficiency:** Ask, "Does condition 'A' always guarantee outcome 'B'?" If the answer is YES, then 'A' is a sufficient condition.
4.  **State the Relationship Precisely:** Use precise language in your output. For example, "A is required for B, but does not guarantee it," or "A is one of several ways to achieve B."

## Constraints

- Do NOT assume a condition is sufficient just because it is necessary.
- Do NOT confuse correlation with a necessary or sufficient condition.
