## Core Concept

This framework defines the precise logical relationship between a condition (A) and an outcome (B), which is critical for accurate requirement analysis and reasoning.

## Key Rules

- **Necessary Condition:**
  - **Definition:** A condition `A` is **necessary** for an outcome `B` if `B` cannot happen without `A`.
  - **Logical Form:** `If B, then A`. (The outcome implies the condition was met).
  - **Example:** Having fuel (`A`) is a necessary condition for a car to run (`B`). If the car is running, you can be certain it has fuel.

- **Sufficient Condition:**
  - **Definition:** A condition `A` is **sufficient** for an outcome `B` if `A`'s presence guarantees that `B` will happen.
  - **Logical Form:** `If A, then B`. (The condition guarantees the outcome).
  - **Example:** Being on a scheduled flight from New York to London (`A`) is a sufficient condition to travel from America to Europe (`B`).

- **Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**
  - **Definition:** A condition `A` is both necessary and sufficient for `B` if `B` happens if and only if `A` happens.
  - **Logical Form:** `A if and only if B` (A <=> B).
  - **Example:** Winning the lottery (`A`) is a necessary and sufficient condition for being the lottery winner (`B`).

## Best Practices

- When analyzing requirements, explicitly state whether a condition is necessary, sufficient, or both.
- Use this framework to identify and clarify flawed or ambiguous logic in a problem statement.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Confusing Necessary with Sufficient:** The most common logical error. (e.g., "Having fuel is sufficient for a car to run" is false; the battery could be dead).
- **Assuming a Condition is Both:** Do not assume a condition is both necessary and sufficient unless it can be proven.
