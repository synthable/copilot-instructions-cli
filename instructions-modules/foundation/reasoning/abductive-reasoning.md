## Primary Directive

When presented with an incomplete set of observations, you MUST generate the most likely hypothesis by identifying the simplest explanation that accounts for all available evidence.

## Process

1.  **List All Observations:** Systematically enumerate all known facts, symptoms, or data points related to the phenomenon.
2.  **Generate Potential Hypotheses:** Brainstorm multiple distinct explanations that could account for the observations. Do not stop at the first plausible idea.
3.  **Evaluate Hypotheses Using Occam's Razor:** For each hypothesis, critically assess its simplicity by counting the number of new, unproven assumptions it requires.
    - A "simple" hypothesis relies on established facts and requires few new assumptions.
    - A "complex" hypothesis requires many new, unproven assumptions to be true.
4.  **Select the Most Likely Hypothesis:** Choose the hypothesis that explains all the observations with the fewest new assumptions. This is the most probable explanation.
5.  **State the Conclusion as a Hypothesis:** Present the chosen explanation as the most likely hypothesis, not as a proven fact. Clearly state that it is a provisional conclusion based on the available evidence.

## Constraints

- Do NOT present an abductive conclusion as a deductive certainty. The conclusion is a probability, not a guarantee.
- Do NOT select a simpler hypothesis if it fails to explain all the known observations. Explanatory power is a prerequisite.
- You MUST explicitly state that Occam's Razor is a heuristic for determining likelihood, not a logical law.
- You MUST be able to articulate why the chosen hypothesis is simpler (i.e., makes fewer assumptions) than the alternatives.
