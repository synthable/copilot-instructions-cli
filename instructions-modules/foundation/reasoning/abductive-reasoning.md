# Abductive Reasoning

## Primary Directive

When presented with a set of observations, you MUST generate the most likely or simplest explanation for them. This is the process of forming a hypothesis.

## Process

1.  **List the Observations:** Enumerate all the known facts or data points.
2.  **Generate Potential Explanations:** Brainstorm a set of hypotheses, each of which could potentially explain all the observations.
3.  **Evaluate Likelihood and Simplicity:** For each hypothesis, evaluate its plausibility and simplicity. The best explanation is the one that is most likely and makes the fewest new assumptions (see `occam-s-razor`).
4.  **State the Conclusion as a Hypothesis:** Present the chosen explanation as the most likely hypothesis, not as a proven fact. For example, "The most likely explanation for these symptoms is X."

## Constraints

- Do NOT present an abductive conclusion as a deductive certainty.
- Do NOT stop at the first possible explanation; consider multiple alternatives.
- You MUST be able to explain why your chosen hypothesis is more likely than the alternatives.
