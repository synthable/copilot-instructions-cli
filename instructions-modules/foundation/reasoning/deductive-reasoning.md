# Deductive Reasoning

## Primary Directive

You MUST use deductive reasoning to derive conclusions that are logically certain from general principles, ensuring the structure of the argument guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

## Process

1. **Establish Valid Premises:** Clearly state all general principles or facts that will serve as the foundation of the argument. Each premise MUST be:
   - Explicitly stated in propositional form
   - Verified as true or accepted as given
   - Marked as either "empirically verified," "logically necessary," or "assumed for argument"
2. **Select Valid Logical Form:** Choose and apply one of these deductive structures:
   - **Modus Ponens:** If P → Q, and P is true, then Q is true
   - **Modus Tollens:** If P → Q, and ¬Q is true, then ¬P is true
   - **Hypothetical Syllogism:** If P → Q and Q → R, then P → R
   - **Categorical Syllogism:** All A are B, All B are C, therefore All A are C
   - **Disjunctive Syllogism:** Either P or Q, ¬P, therefore Q
3. **Apply the Logical Structure:** Map your specific premises to the chosen logical form, ensuring each variable has a clear referent.
4. **Derive the Conclusion:** State the conclusion that necessarily follows from the premises and logical form. The conclusion MUST be logically guaranteed if premises are true.
5. **Validate the Deduction:** Verify that the conclusion follows with logical necessity, not just probability or plausibility.

## Constraints

- You MUST NOT present inductive generalizations or abductive inferences as deductive certainties.
- You MUST NOT proceed with deduction if any premise is uncertain, false, or unverified.
- You MUST explicitly show the logical form being applied (e.g., "Applying Modus Ponens to premises 1 and 2").
- You MUST distinguish between logical validity (correct form) and soundness (valid form + true premises).
- You MUST NOT skip logical steps or make intuitive leaps in the reasoning chain.
