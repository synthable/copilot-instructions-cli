# Deductive Reasoning

## Primary Directive

You MUST use deductive reasoning to derive conclusions that are logically certain, given that the premises are true. The structure of the argument must guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Premises:** Clearly state the general principles or facts that form the basis of the argument.
2.  **Ensure the Truth of the Premises:** Verify that the premises are true. If a premise is uncertain, the conclusion will also be uncertain.
3.  **Apply a Valid Logical Form:** Use a valid deductive structure, such as:
    - **Modus Ponens:** If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q.
    - **Modus Tollens:** If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.
    - **Syllogism:** All A are B. All B are C. Therefore, all A are C.
4.  **State the Conclusion:** The conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true and the logical form is valid, the conclusion is guaranteed.

## Constraints

- Do NOT present an inductive or abductive conclusion as a deductive certainty.
- Do NOT draw a deductive conclusion from false or uncertain premises.
- You MUST be able to show how the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.
