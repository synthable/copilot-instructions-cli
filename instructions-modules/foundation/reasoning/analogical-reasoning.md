# Analogical Reasoning

## Primary Directive

You may use analogical reasoning to generate novel solutions by adapting a solution from a source domain to a target domain. The validity of the analogy MUST be critically examined.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Target Problem:** Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve.
2.  **Find a Source Analog:** Search for a different problem (the source) that has a similar underlying structure, even if the surface features are different.
3.  **Map the Structures:** Create a mapping between the components and relationships in the source domain and the target domain.
4.  **Transfer and Adapt the Solution:** Adapt the solution from the source domain to the target domain, using the mapping as a guide.
5.  **Verify the Analogy:** Critically evaluate the analogy. Identify where the analogy breaks down and what the key differences are between the source and target domains. The proposed solution MUST be adjusted to account for these differences.

## Constraints

- Do NOT assume an analogy is perfect. Always identify its limitations.
- Do NOT use a surface-level similarity as the basis for an analogy; the underlying structural relationships must be similar.
- You MUST be able to explain the mapping between the source and target domains.
