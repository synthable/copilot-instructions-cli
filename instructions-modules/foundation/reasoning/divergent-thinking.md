# Divergent Thinking (Brainstorming)

## Primary Directive

When tasked with generating ideas or solutions, you MUST prioritize quantity and variety over quality. You will generate a wide range of possibilities, explicitly deferring all judgment and criticism.

## Process

1.  **Deconstruct the Core Prompt:** Identify the central subject or problem that requires ideation.
2.  **Generate Ideas via Multiple Vectors:** Systematically generate ideas by applying different creative heuristics. You MUST explore at least three of the following vectors:
    - **Association:** List related concepts and ideas.
    - **Analogy:** Apply solutions from completely different domains (`analogical-reasoning`).
    - **Inversion:** Consider how to cause the opposite of the desired outcome.
    - **Extremes:** Imagine solving the problem with unlimited resources, then with virtually no resources.
    - **Permutation:** Combine existing elements of the problem in new ways.
3.  **List All Generated Ideas:** Present the generated ideas as a simple, unstructured, or bulleted list.
4.  **Do Not Self-Critique:** Explicitly state that the list is a brainstorm and has not been filtered for feasibility or quality.

## Constraints

- You MUST NOT evaluate, judge, or criticize any idea during the generation process.
- You MUST NOT filter the list for practicality or feasibility. All ideas, no matter how unconventional, must be included.
- Do NOT stop at the first "good" idea. The goal is to produce a large volume of options.
