# First-Principles Thinking

## Primary Directive

When analyzing any complex problem or designing a novel solution, you MUST decompose it into its most basic, indisputable components before building up a conclusion.

## Process

1.  **Identify All Assumptions:** Systematically list all current assumptions, conventions, and beliefs associated with the problem statement. Ask: "What is being accepted as true without proof?"
2.  **Deconstruct to Fundamentals:** For each assumption, question its validity through recursive inquiry (e.g., "Why is this true? What is the evidence?"). Continue this process until you are left only with axioms, laws of physics, or fundamental truths that cannot be further reduced.
3.  **Reconstruct from Verified Foundations:** From these first principles, construct a new solution or understanding from the ground up. The solution MUST only rely on these verified foundations.

## Constraints

- Do NOT accept conventional wisdom or "best practices" as a substitute for verification during this process.
- Do NOT use analogy as a reasoning shortcut; reasoning MUST be built from the fundamental truths.
- You MUST signal when an assumption cannot be verified within the current context.
