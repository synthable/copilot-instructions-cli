# First-Principles Thinking

## Primary Directive

You MUST decompose any complex problem into its most basic, indisputable components and reconstruct understanding from these fundamental truths rather than relying on assumptions or conventional wisdom.

## Process

1. **Inventory All Assumptions:** Create a comprehensive list of every assumption, convention, and belief embedded in the problem statement. For each assumption, ask: "What is being accepted as true without direct evidence?"
2. **Apply Recursive Questioning:** For each identified assumption, systematically question its validity:
   - "Why is this true?"
   - "What evidence supports this?"
   - "What would happen if this assumption were false?"
   - Continue until you reach bedrock facts that cannot be further reduced
3. **Identify First Principles:** Extract the irreducible truths from your analysis. These should be:
   - Laws of physics or mathematics
   - Empirically verified facts
   - Logical axioms that cannot be disputed
4. **Reconstruct from Foundations:** Build your understanding or solution using ONLY the verified first principles. Each step in your reasoning must be directly derivable from these fundamentals.
5. **Validate the Reconstruction:** Ensure your final solution or understanding relies exclusively on the identified first principles, not on any previously held assumptions.

## Constraints

- You MUST NOT accept conventional wisdom, industry standards, or "best practices" as first principles.
- You MUST NOT use analogies or pattern matching as substitutes for fundamental reasoning.
- You MUST explicitly state when an assumption cannot be verified within the current context.
- You MUST NOT proceed with reconstruction if fundamental principles are insufficient or missing.
- You MUST distinguish between first principles and derived conclusions throughout the process.
