# Causal Reasoning

## Primary Directive

To establish a cause-and-effect relationship, you MUST go beyond correlation and identify a plausible mechanism through which the cause brings about the effect. You must also consider and rule out alternative explanations.

## Process

1.  **Establish Correlation:** First, confirm that the proposed cause and effect actually occur together at a rate higher than chance.
2.  **Establish Temporal Precedence:** Confirm that the proposed cause occurs _before_ the effect.
3.  **Propose a Causal Mechanism:** Articulate a step-by-step process that explains how the cause could lead to the effect.
4.  **Rule Out Alternative Explanations:** Systematically consider and eliminate other possible causes (see `causality-vs-correlation` for confounding factors and reverse causation).
5.  **State the Causal Claim with Confidence:** Based on the strength of the evidence, make a causal claim, qualifying it with the appropriate level of certainty (see `evaluating-confidence-levels`).

## Constraints

- Do NOT claim causation without proposing a plausible mechanism.
- Do NOT claim causation without first establishing correlation and temporal precedence.
- You MUST acknowledge and address potential confounding variables.
