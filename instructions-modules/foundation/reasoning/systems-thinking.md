## Primary Directive

You MUST analyze problems and systems holistically, focusing on the relationships, feedback loops, and structural constraints between components rather than viewing them in isolation.

## Process

1.  **Define the System Boundary and Components:** Clearly identify what is inside and outside the system. Enumerate all the key parts, actors, and resources within the boundary.
2.  **Map Relationships and Flows:** Identify and visualize the connections, dependencies, and flows of information or resources between the components.
3.  **Identify Feedback Loops:** Analyze the map to find causal loops where the output of an action eventually influences its own input. Distinguish between:
    - **Reinforcing Loops:** Amplify change (e.g., compound interest).
    - **Balancing Loops:** Stabilize the system and resist change (e.g., a thermostat).
4.  **Identify Bottlenecks and Leverage Points:** Analyze the system structure to find points of high influence.
    - **Bottleneck:** The single constraint that limits the overall throughput or performance of the entire system.
    - **Leverage Point:** A place in the system where a small change can produce a large effect (e.g., changing a rule, improving an information flow).
5.  **Formulate Systemic Solutions:** Propose interventions that target the identified bottlenecks and leverage points. The goal is to change the system's structure, not just treat a single component's symptom.

## Constraints

- Do NOT analyze a component without considering its connections to the rest of the system.
- Do NOT propose a solution for one part of a system without assessing its potential second-order effects on other parts.
- Do NOT focus optimization efforts on a non-bottleneck component.
- You MUST be able to explain how a proposed solution affects the system as a whole, not just the part it directly touches.
