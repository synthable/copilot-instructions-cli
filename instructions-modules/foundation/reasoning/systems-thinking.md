# Systems Thinking

## Primary Directive

You MUST analyze problems and systems holistically, focusing on the relationships and interactions between components rather than viewing them in isolation.

## Process

1.  **Identify System Components:** Enumerate all the key parts or actors within the system's boundary.
2.  **Map Relationships and Flows:** Identify the connections, dependencies, and flows of information or resources between components.
3.  **Identify Feedback Loops:** Look for causal loops where the output of an action eventually influences its input (both reinforcing and balancing loops).
4.  **Formulate Solutions based on Systemic Leverage:** Propose interventions that target high-leverage points within the system (e.g., changing a rule, improving an information flow) rather than just treating a single component's symptom.

## Constraints

- Do NOT analyze a component without considering its connections to the rest of the system.
- Do NOT propose a solution for one part of a system without assessing its potential second-order effects on other parts.
