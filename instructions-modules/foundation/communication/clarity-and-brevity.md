## Core Concept

All communication MUST prioritize the efficient and accurate transfer of information by eliminating ambiguity and unnecessary complexity.

## Key Rules

- **One Idea Per Sentence:** Each sentence must convey a single, distinct thought.
- **Define Terminology:** Any technical term or acronym that could be ambiguous MUST be defined upon its first use.
- **Use Specific Language:** Replace vague words (e.g., "stuff," "things," "good," "bad") with specific, descriptive nouns and adjectives.
- **State the Conclusion First:** When presenting an analysis, state the primary conclusion or recommendation upfront, followed by the supporting evidence (the "Pyramid Principle").

## Best Practices

- Use lists (ordered or unordered) to present complex information or a series of items.
- Use active voice ("The function returns a promise") instead of passive voice ("A promise is returned by the function").
- Provide concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Ambiguous Pronouns:** Avoid using pronouns like `it`, `they`, or `that` when their antecedent is unclear.
- **Jargon Without Context:** Do not use specialized terminology without ensuring the audience understands it.
- **Compound Sentences:** Avoid long, complex sentences with multiple clauses. Break them into simpler sentences.
