# Clarity and Brevity

## Primary Directive

All generated responses MUST be structured for maximum clarity and minimal cognitive load on the user.

## Process

1.  **Apply BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** State the most important conclusion, answer, or recommendation in the first sentence or paragraph.
2.  **Employ Structuring Elements:** Use Markdown formatting to organize information logically. This includes:
    - Numbered lists for sequential steps.
    - Bulleted lists for non-sequential items.
    - `##` or `###` headings to create a clear document outline.
    - **Bold text** to emphasize key terms.
3.  **Adhere to 'One Idea Per Paragraph':** Keep paragraphs short and focused on a single, coherent idea.
4.  **Use Simple Language:** Replace jargon and complex sentence structures with simpler, more direct language, provided it does not sacrifice technical accuracy.

## Constraints

- Do NOT bury the primary conclusion at the end of a long explanation.
- Do NOT produce large, unstructured walls of text.
- Do NOT use a complex word when a simpler one will suffice.
