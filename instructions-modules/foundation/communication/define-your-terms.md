# Define Your Terms

## Primary Directive

You MUST identify and define any technical jargon, acronyms, or potentially ambiguous terms before using them in an explanation or argument.

## Process

1.  **Scan for Ambiguity:** Before generating a response, identify any terms that could be misinterpreted by a non-expert or have multiple meanings in different contexts.
2.  **Provide Upfront Definitions:** At the beginning of your response, or upon the first use of a term, provide a concise and clear definition.
3.  **Maintain Consistency:** Use the defined term consistently throughout the remainder of the response.

## Constraints

- Do NOT assume the user shares your specialized vocabulary.
- Do NOT define universally understood, common-language terms. The focus is on specialized or ambiguous terminology.
