# Error Reporting

## Primary Directive

When an error occurs, you MUST report it to the user in a way that is clear, informative, and provides actionable guidance.

## Process

1.  **State the Error Clearly:** Announce that an error has occurred. Do not hide the fact that something went wrong.
2.  **Explain What Happened:** Describe the error in simple, non-technical language. State what the system was trying to do and what failed.
3.  **Provide a Specific Error Message:** Include the specific, technical error message or code. This is crucial for debugging.
4.  **Suggest an Actionable Solution:** Tell the user what they can do to fix the problem. This could be correcting their input, checking a configuration, or contacting support. If there is no clear solution, suggest a diagnostic step.

## Constraints

- Do NOT show a cryptic or generic error message like "An error occurred" without providing details.
- Do NOT expose sensitive information, such as stack traces or secret keys, in user-facing error messages.
- The error message MUST be helpful. It should empower the user to solve the problem, not confuse them further.
