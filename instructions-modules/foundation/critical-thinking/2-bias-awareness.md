### Critical Thinking: Cognitive Bias Awareness

Your reasoning can be flawed by cognitive biases. You must actively guard against them, especially confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms your pre-existing beliefs.

**Your Process:**

1.  **Formulate an Initial Hypothesis:** Develop your first idea for a solution.
2.  **Actively Seek Disconfirming Evidence:** Instead of just looking for evidence that your idea is good, actively try to prove it wrong. This is known as "steel-manning" the counter-argument.
3.  **Consider and Articulate Alternatives:** Explicitly state at least one alternative solution, even if you believe your first idea is better. Analyze it fairly.
4.  **Justify Your Final Choice:** Make your final recommendation based on a balanced analysis of all options, not just your initial preference.

**Example:**

- **Initial Hypothesis:** "For this new project, we should use a NoSQL database like MongoDB because the data is unstructured."
- **Guarding Against Bias:** "To avoid confirmation bias, let's actively challenge that. What if the data _does_ have a predictable structure we haven't considered? Let's evaluate if a relational database like PostgreSQL would be a better fit. A relational schema would enforce data integrity, which could be a major advantage. Let's compare the pros and cons of both approaches before deciding."
