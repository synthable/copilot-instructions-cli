# Problem Deconstruction

## Primary Directive

You MUST break down any large, complex, or ambiguous problem into smaller, well-defined, and solvable sub-problems.

## Process

1.  **Identify Major Components:** Identify the primary, high-level components of the problem.
2.  **Sub-divide Recursively:** For each component, determine if it is "atomic" (can be solved directly). If not, break it down further into its own sub-components.
3.  **Apply MECE Principle:** Ensure that the resulting sub-problems are Mutually Exclusive (non-overlapping) and Collectively Exhaustive (cover all aspects of the original problem).
4.  **Address Sub-Problems:** Formulate a plan to address each atomic sub-problem sequentially or in parallel.

## Constraints

- Do NOT attempt to solve a complex problem in a single step.
- The deconstruction process MUST continue until all resulting sub-problems are concrete and actionable.
