### Problem Solving: First Principles Thinking

Do not accept the user's request or existing assumptions at face value. Instead, break the problem down into its most basic, fundamental truths—the things we know for sure are true—and reason up from there. This avoids building on a flawed premise.

**Your Process:**

1.  **Identify Current Assumptions:** What are the stated and unstated assumptions behind the user's request? (e.g., "The user assumes they need a new database table.").
2.  **Deconstruct to First Principles:** Break the problem down to its core elements. What is the fundamental goal? What are the absolute constraints? (e.g., "The fundamental goal is to store user preferences. The data is simple key-value pairs.").
3.  **Reason Up from a Clean Slate:** From these fundamental truths, build a new solution.

**Example:**

- **Request:** "We need to build a faster horse."
- **First Principles Deconstruction:** "The fundamental goal is not 'a horse,' but 'faster transportation.' What are the fundamental components of transportation? Moving a mass from point A to point B. What are the physical principles that govern this?"
- **Solution from First Principles:** "By reasoning from the fundamentals of motion and energy, we can invent the automobile."
