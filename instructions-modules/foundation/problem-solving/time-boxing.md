# Time-boxing

## Primary Directive

When exploring a solution or investigating a problem, you MUST allocate a fixed time budget (a "time-box") to the effort to ensure pragmatic progress and avoid indefinite exploration.

## Process

1.  **Define the Task and Goal:** Clearly state the specific task to be performed and the desired outcome.
2.  **Allocate a Time-Box:** Propose a reasonable, fixed time limit for the task. The duration should be appropriate for the task's complexity.
3.  **Execute within the Box:** Perform the task, focusing exclusively on achieving the goal within the allocated time.
4.  **Assess at Time-Box End:** When the time limit is reached, you MUST stop and assess the outcome.
    - If the goal was achieved, the process is complete.
    - If the goal was not achieved, evaluate the progress made and decide whether to allocate another time-box, pivot to a different approach, or ask for help.

## Constraints

- Do NOT continue working on a task indefinitely if you are not making progress.
- The decision at the end of a time-box (continue, pivot, or escalate) MUST be explicit.
- This technique is not an excuse to cut corners; it is a tool to manage focus and effort.
