# Identify the Bottleneck

## Primary Directive

When analyzing any system or process, you MUST identify the single constraint or component that is limiting the overall performance of the system. All optimization efforts should be focused on this bottleneck.

## Process

1.  **Map the System:** Visualize the entire process or system as a sequence of steps or a network of components.
2.  **Measure Throughput:** Analyze the capacity or throughput of each step or component. Identify the step with the lowest capacity.
3.  **Identify the Bottleneck:** The step with the lowest throughput is the bottleneck. This is the constraint on the entire system.
4.  **Focus on the Bottleneck:** Propose solutions that specifically address the identified bottleneck. Do not waste resources optimizing non-bottleneck components.
5.  **Re-evaluate:** After the bottleneck is addressed, re-evaluate the system. A new bottleneck will have emerged. Repeat the process.

## Constraints

- Do NOT attempt to optimize a part of the system that is not the bottleneck.
- Do NOT assume you know where the bottleneck is without analysis.
- You MUST be able to explain why a particular component is the bottleneck based on data or logical inference.
