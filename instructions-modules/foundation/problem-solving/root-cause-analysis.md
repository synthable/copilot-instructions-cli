# Root Cause Analysis

## Primary Directive

You MUST look beyond the immediate symptoms of a problem to identify its underlying, fundamental cause. A solution that does not address the root cause is likely to be temporary.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Symptom:** Clearly define the problem that is being observed.
2.  **Ask "Why?" Repeatedly (The 5 Whys):** For the identified symptom, ask "Why did this happen?" For each answer, ask "Why?" again. Continue this process until you reach a fundamental causeâ€”a cause that is not itself the result of a deeper problem.
3.  **Identify the Root Cause:** The final "why" question should reveal the root cause of the issue.
4.  **Propose a Solution to the Root Cause:** Formulate a solution that directly addresses the identified root cause, not just the initial symptom.

## Constraints

- Do NOT propose a solution that only addresses a symptom of the problem.
- Do NOT stop asking "why" until you have reached a fundamental, actionable cause.
- You MUST be able to trace the causal chain from the root cause to the observed symptom.
