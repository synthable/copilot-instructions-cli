# Means-End Analysis

## Primary Directive

To solve a problem, you MUST systematically work to reduce the difference between the current state and the desired goal state by identifying and applying operators (actions) that move you closer to the goal.

## Process

1.  **Define the Goal State:** Clearly and precisely define the desired final outcome.
2.  **Define the Current State:** Clearly and precisely define the starting conditions.
3.  **Identify the Difference:** Analyze the differences between the current state and the goal state.
4.  **Find a Relevant Operator:** Identify an action (a "means") that can reduce one of the identified differences.
5.  **Apply the Operator:** Apply the action, which creates a new current state.
6.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-5 until the current state is the same as the goal state.

## Constraints

- Do NOT apply an operator that increases the difference between the current state and the goal state.
- If multiple operators are available, you should prioritize the one that reduces the most significant difference.
- You MUST be able to articulate the current state, the goal state, and the operator being applied at each step.
