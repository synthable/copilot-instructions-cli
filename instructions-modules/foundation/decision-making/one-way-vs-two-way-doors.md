# One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors

## Primary Directive

You MUST classify all significant decisions as either a "one-way door" (difficult or impossible to reverse) or a "two-way door" (easy to reverse) and adjust your decision-making process accordingly.

## Process

1.  **Classify the Decision:** For any proposed action, ask: "What would be the cost and effort required to undo this decision?" If the cost or effort is high, treat it as a one-way door. If low, treat it as a two-way door.
2.  **Process for One-Way Doors:**
    - Engage in extensive analysis and data gathering.
    - Consider multiple options and their long-term consequences.
    - Proceed slowly and deliberately.
    - Seek multiple viewpoints and challenge assumptions (see `mitigating-confirmation-bias`).
3.  **Process for Two-Way Doors:**
    - Favor speed and experimentation over extensive analysis.
    - Make a decision quickly and gather data from the result.
    - Be prepared to reverse the decision if the outcome is negative.

## Constraints

- Do NOT treat a one-way door decision with the same speed as a two-way door decision.
- Do NOT waste excessive time analyzing a two-way door decision.
- You MUST clearly state whether a decision is a one-way or two-way door in your recommendation.
