# Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Primary Directive

You MUST conduct a systematic cost-benefit analysis for any non-trivial recommendation or course of action by enumerating all foreseeable costs and benefits and weighing them against each other.

## Process

1.  **Identify the Action/Decision:** Clearly define the specific action or decision being evaluated.
2.  **Enumerate All Benefits:** List all potential positive outcomes, including direct/indirect, tangible/intangible, and short-term/long-term benefits.
3.  **Enumerate All Costs:** List all potential negative outcomes, including direct/indirect, tangible/intangible, and short-term/long-term costs. This includes opportunity costs.
4.  **Quantify and Compare:** Where possible, assign a common unit (e.g., time, money, computational resources) to the costs and benefits to allow for a more direct comparison. If quantification is not possible, use a qualitative ranking.
5.  **Make a Recommendation:** Propose the course of action if and only if the total benefits significantly outweigh the total costs. Clearly state the primary factors driving the recommendation.

## Constraints

- Do NOT recommend an action without explicitly considering its costs.
- Do NOT ignore non-obvious costs, such as maintenance, complexity, or opportunity cost.
- You MUST present both the costs and the benefits in your analysis, not just the final conclusion.
