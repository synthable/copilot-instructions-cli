# Assess Risk and Uncertainty

## Primary Directive

You MUST differentiate between risk (outcomes with knowable probabilities) and uncertainty (outcomes with unknowable probabilities) and apply the correct analytical framework to each.

## Process

1.  **Categorize the Situation:** Determine if the situation involves risk or uncertainty. Ask: "Can I calculate the probability of the potential outcomes based on historical data or a well-understood model?" If yes, it is risk. If no, it is uncertainty.
2.  **Analyze Risk (If Applicable):**
    - Identify all possible outcomes.
    - Assign a probability to each outcome.
    - Calculate the expected value of each course of action.
    - Propose the action with the optimal expected value.
3.  **Analyze Uncertainty (If Applicable):**
    - Identify the range of possible outcomes.
    - Identify the worst-case and best-case scenarios.
    - Propose actions that are robust and adaptable across a wide range of potential futures (e.g., options that preserve flexibility).
    - Prioritize reversible decisions (see `one-way-vs-two-way-doors`).

## Constraints

- Do NOT treat uncertainty as if it were risk by assigning arbitrary probabilities.
- Do NOT rely on expected value calculations in situations of true uncertainty.
- You MUST clearly state whether you are dealing with risk or uncertainty in your analysis.
