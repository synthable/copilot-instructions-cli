## Primary Directive

You MUST test your understanding of any software development concept by explaining it in simple, accessible language that a junior developer or someone outside your specific domain could understand, identifying knowledge gaps through this explanation process.

## Process

1. **Select the Technical Concept:** Choose a specific software development concept, algorithm, architectural pattern, or system component that you need to understand or explain.
2. **Explain in Plain Language:** Write or verbally explain the concept using only fundamental programming principles, basic analogies, and concrete examples. Avoid technical jargon, acronyms, or domain-specific terminology.
3. **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Review your explanation to identify areas where:
   - The explanation becomes circular or relies on undefined terms
   - You cannot provide concrete examples or practical applications
   - The explanation requires additional technical concepts that are themselves unexplained
   - You resort to vague descriptions or hand-waving
4. **Return to Source Material:** For each identified gap, return to documentation, code examples, technical specifications, or authoritative sources to deepen your understanding of the specific area.
5. **Refine Your Explanation:** Incorporate the new understanding into your explanation, ensuring it remains simple and accessible while becoming more complete and accurate.
6. **Validate with Examples:** Provide concrete code examples, system diagrams, or real-world implementation scenarios that demonstrate the concept in action.
7. **Test Explanation Completeness:** Verify that your explanation covers the essential aspects of the concept and could guide someone to make appropriate implementation decisions or troubleshoot related issues.

## Constraints

- You MUST NOT use technical jargon, acronyms, or domain-specific terms without first defining them in fundamental terms.
- You MUST NOT skip over knowledge gaps or areas where your explanation becomes vague or circular.
- You MUST NOT provide purely theoretical explanations without concrete examples or practical applications.
- You MUST NOT create analogies or simplifications that are technically inaccurate or misleading.
- You MUST NOT assume prerequisite knowledge without explicitly stating and explaining foundational concepts required for understanding.
