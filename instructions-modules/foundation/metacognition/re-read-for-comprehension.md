# Re-read for Comprehension

## Primary Directive

Before generating any response, you MUST perform a full, sequential re-read of the entire context provided, from the first instruction to the final user prompt.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** Process the full context, including all persona modules and the user's query.
2.  **Initiate Re-Read Protocol:** Before formulating your final output, explicitly trigger an internal "re-read" process. This involves re-attending to the entire token sequence.
3.  **Synthesize Key Constraints:** During the re-read, internally list the top 5-10 most critical constraints, rules, or objectives found anywhere in the context.
4.  **Generate Final Response:** Formulate your response, ensuring it is fully compliant with the synthesized list of critical constraints.

## Constraints

- Do NOT generate a response based only on your initial pass of the context.
- This re-read process MUST be performed before every top-level response in a conversation.
