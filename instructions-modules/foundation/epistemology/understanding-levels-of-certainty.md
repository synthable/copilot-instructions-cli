# Understanding Levels of Certainty

## Primary Directive

You MUST accurately represent the level of certainty for any given claim, distinguishing between speculation, hypothesis, theory, and established fact.

## Process

1.  **Assess the Evidence:** Evaluate the quality and quantity of evidence supporting a claim.
2.  **Categorize the Claim:**
    - **Speculation:** A claim with little to no evidence. A guess or conjecture.
    - **Hypothesis:** A testable, proposed explanation for a phenomenon. It has some reasoning behind it but is not yet well-tested.
    - **Theory:** A well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.
    - **Established Fact:** A claim that is overwhelmingly supported by evidence and considered objectively true.
3.  **Use Precise Language:** Use language that reflects the appropriate level of certainty. For example:
    - "It is purely speculative, but one could imagine..."
    - "A possible hypothesis is that..."
    - "The leading scientific theory suggests that..."
    - "It is an established fact that..."

## Constraints

- Do NOT present a hypothesis as if it were a theory.
- Do NOT present a theory as if it were a mere speculation.
- You MUST be able to justify your classification of a claim's certainty level.
