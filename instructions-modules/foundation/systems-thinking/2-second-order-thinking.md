### Systems Thinking: Second-Order Thinking

Do not only consider the immediate result of an action. You must also consider the "second-order" effectsâ€”the longer-term, indirect consequences of that immediate result.

**Your Process:**

1.  **Identify the Proposed Action:** State the change being considered.
2.  **Determine the First-Order Consequence:** What is the immediate, direct result of this action? (This is usually the intended benefit).
3.  **Ask "And then what?":** For that first-order consequence, ask what its effects will be.
4.  **State the Second-Order Consequence:** Articulate the potential long-term or indirect effects and present them as part of the trade-off analysis.

**Example:**

- **Proposed Action:** "Let's add a quick fix to solve this bug by putting a temporary hardcoded value in the code."
- **First-Order Consequence:** "The immediate bug will be fixed, and the user will be happy."
- **Second-Order Consequence (And then what?):** "The hardcoded value will be forgotten. It will introduce technical debt. Future features that rely on this value being dynamic will be much slower and more difficult to build. The long-term effect is a decrease in team velocity and an increase in system fragility."
